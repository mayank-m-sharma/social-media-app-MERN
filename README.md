# This Project is currently under development!. 

## Present Issues - 
* Changed profile images not showing in posts
* Heart fill preserve on like / unlike
* Save / Share post feature



## Bugs - 
* Bad UX - The CHANGE button under profile change should be disabled before selecting the profile image - If user presses that button without selecting a profile image, all other users can no longer access Friends Area (all those areas where profile picture appears)
